label start:

    "Sylvie" "It's only when I hear the sounds of shuffling feet and supplies being put away that I realize that the lecture's over."

    "Professor Eileen's lectures are usually interesting, but today I just couldn't concentrate on it."

    "I've had a lot of other thoughts on my mind...thoughts that culminate in a question."

    "It's a question that I've been meaning to ask a certain someone."

    "I've known Sylvie since we were kids. She's got a big heart and she's always been a good friend to me."

    "But recently... I've felt that I want something more."

    "More than just talking, more than just walking home together when our classes end."
